The present inventors have demonstrated that WFS1, which loss of function is responsible of the Wolfram Syndrome, forms a complex with the neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). The inventors have further demonstrated that WFS1 associates with NCS1 to prevent its degradation by the proteasome and that NCS1 regulates VDAC expression and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Thus, present invention provides an agonist of NCS1 for use in the treatment of WS. Such an agonist is e.g. a NCS1-encoding polynucleotide, an inhibitor of the proteasome or of calpains. The inventors have further shown that overexpression of NCS1 in WS cells allows increasing complex II driven respiration. The present invention further relates to a method for predicting the severity of WS by measuring the NCS1 level in a sample obtained from a patient.

Training word images and their concept labels are used to learn parameters of a neural network for embedding word images and concepts in a semantic subspace in which comparisons can be made between word images and concepts without the need for transcribing the text content of the word image. The training of the neural network aims to minimize a ranking loss over the training set where non relevant concepts for an image which are ranked more highly than relevant ones penalize the ranking loss.

Contextual memory bandit for proactive dialogs	10,635,707	G06F 16/435 (20190101); G06F 16/335 (20190101); G06F 16/907 (20190101); G06F 16/3329 (20190101)	G06F 16/435 (20190101); G06F 16/335 (20190101); G06F 16/332 (20190101); G06F 16/907 (20190101)Perez; Julien (Grenoble, FR), Silander; Tomi (Grenoble, FR)	Xerox Corporation	A proactive interaction system includes memory which stores a contextual model. The contextual model includes supporting memory storing a representation of each of a set of past observations. Each of the past observations having an observed reward for a respective user for a respective action selected from a set of candidate actions. The contextual model is configured for estimating a reward for each of a current set of candidate actions, based on the stored representations of past observations and a representation of a current user. Each candidate action is associated with a respective action representation. A contextual bandit selects one of the candidate actions, based on the estimated reward for each of the set of candidate actions, to optimize a cumulative reward over a sequence of candidate action selections. An act output component performs a user-detectable act based on the selected one of the candidate actions.

The static brake and electric motor generate respectively an upper threshold brake force and an upper threshold motor force. An immobilization operation provides that the static brake generates the upper threshold brake force and the electric motor is stopped. A slippage detection operation provides that the control unit detects whether an electric actuator is moving despite the static brake. If the electric actuator is moving, a motor energizing operation provides that the electric motor generates a motor force equal or superior to upper threshold brake force in a direction opposite to the slippage direction. After energizing the motor, a brake release operation provides that the control unit releases the static brake.

An envelope tracking (ET) amplifier apparatus is provided. The ET amplifier apparatus includes a number of amplifier circuits that can be activated concurrently or selectively for amplifying a number of radio frequency (RF) signals. Notably, some amplifier circuits may amplify RF signals corresponding to a higher modulation bandwidth (e.g., >80 MHz), while other amplifier circuits may amplify RF signals corresponding to a lower modulation bandwidth (e.g., <40 MHz). In examples discussed herein, the ET amplifier apparatus can be flexibly configured to the amplifier circuits, either concurrently or selectively, to amplify the RF signals corresponding to a wide range of modulation bandwidths, without compromising linearity and efficiency of the amplifier circuits. Moreover, the ET amplifier apparatus may be configured to share a common circuit(s) among a number of circuits, thus helping to reduce footprint of the ET amplifier apparatus.	Qorvo US, Inc.

Optical metrology is used to calibrate the plane-of-incidence (POI) azimuth error by determining and correcting an azimuth angle offset. The azimuth angle offset may be determined by measuring at least a partial Mueller matrix from a calibration grating on a sample held on a stage for a plurality of POI azimuth angles. An axis of symmetry is determined for a curve describing a value of a Mueller matrix element with respect to POI azimuth angle, for each desired wavelength and each desired Mueller matrix element. The axis of symmetry may then be used to determine the azimuth angle offset, e.g., by determining a mean, median or average of all, or a filtered subset, of the axes of symmetry. If desired, an axis of symmetry may be determined for data sets other than Mueller matrix elements, such as Fourier coefficients of measured signals.	ONTO INNOVATION INC.

A sensing device includes a first array of sensing elements, which output a signal indicative of a time of incidence of a single photon on the sensing element. A second array of processing circuits are coupled respectively to the sensing elements and comprise a gating generator, which variably sets a start time of the gating interval for each sensing element within each acquisition period, and a memory, which records the time of incidence of the single photon on each sensing element in each acquisition period. A controller controls the gating generator during a first sequence of the acquisition periods so as to sweep the gating interval over the acquisition periods and to identify a respective detection window for the sensing element, and during a second sequence of the acquisition periods, to fix the gating interval for each sensing element to coincide with the respective detection window.

A liquefaction system is capable of sequentially or simultaneously liquefying multiple feed streams of hydrocarbons having different normal bubble points with minimal flash. The liquefying heat exchanger has separate circuits for handling multiple feed streams. The feed stream with the lowest normal boiling point is sub-cooled sufficiently to suppress most of the flash. Feed streams with relatively high normal boiling points are cooled to substantially the same temperature, then blended with bypass streams to maintain each product near its normal bubble point. The system can also liquefy one stream at a time by using a dedicated circuit or by allocating the same feed to multiple circuits.	Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

A heat exchanger, such as for example, a condenser coil constructed as a fin and microchannel tube is fluidly connected with a volume constructed and configured to store refrigerant in certain operations, such as for example during a pump down operation. The volume is fluidly connected to a fluid port of the heat exchanger, where the fluid port is an inlet (in the cooling mode) to the heat exchanger, such as the high side condensing section of the heat exchanger. The volume receives refrigerant exiting the heat exchanger from the fluid port in a mode other than a cooling mode, e.g., a pump down operation.	TRANE INTERNATIONAL INC.

(Cambridge, GB)	Wang; Wentao Erbes; Andreja Weinstein; Dana Seshia; Ashwin A.	Examples of the present invention include unreleased coupled multi-cavity resonators and transmission filters. In some examples, the resonators include resonant cavities coupled by acoustic couplers (ABGCs) and acoustic reflectors (ABRs). These acoustic components enable improved confinement of acoustic modes within the resonator to increase the quality factor (Q) and lower the motional resistance (R.sub.x). A coupled resonator with 5 cavities coupled by 4 ABGCs can achieve a Q of 1095 while a single-cavity resonator of the same device size has a Q of 760. In some examples, the devices can be configured to work as electronic transmission filters in at least two types of filter configurations. In the transmission line filter configuration, the device can include a filter structure in an arrangement (LH).sup.N H (LH).sup.N, defined as a Fabry-Perot Resonator (FPR). In the multi-pole filter configuration, the device can include a filter structure in an arrangement similar to the multi-cavity resonator design.

Based on a grid representative of the petrophysical properties of a subterranean formation through at least one well is drilled, a reservoir simulation is performed up to a time for which production of the formation being studied is to be predicted. Then, attributes are selected that are representative of the flows in the formation and a classification of these attributes is performed. Then, a quality indicator is computed for each of the classes and at least one class is selected such that its quality indicator is greater than a first threshold.

The present technology is directed to a system and method for implementing network resource partitioning and Quality of Service (QoS) separation through network slicing. Embodiments of the present invention describe scalable network slicing method based on defining Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm to represent a network slice and assigning a distinct QoS policy queue to each of the Flexible Algorithms configured on a network node. Therefore, scalable network slice based queuing is implemented wherein a single packet processing queue is assigned to each Flex-Algorithm based network slice. QoS policy queue may be implemented in a hierarchical fashion by differentiation between flow packets in a single QoS policy queue based on value of experimental bits in the header.

A sketch-based interface within an animation engine provides an end-user with tools for creating emitter textures and oscillator textures. The end-user may create an emitter texture by sketching one or more patch elements and then sketching an emitter. The animation engine animates the sketch by generating a stream of patch elements that emanate from the emitter. The end-user may create an oscillator texture by sketching a patch that includes one or more patch elements, and then sketching a brush skeleton and an oscillation skeleton. The animation engine replicates the patch along the brush skeleton, and then interpolates the replicated patches between the brush skeleton and the oscillation skeleton, thereby causing those replicated patches to periodically oscillate between the two skeletons.

Systems and methods are described for rate-limiting a message-sending client interacting with a message service based on dynamically calculated risk assessments of the probability that the client is, or is not, a sender of a spam messages. The message service sends a proof of work problem to a sending client device with a difficulty level that is related to a risk assessment that the client is a sender of spam messages. The message system limits the rate at which a known or suspected spammer can send messages by giving the known or suspected spammer client harder proof of work problems to solve, while minimizing the burden on normal users of the message system by given them easier proof of work problems to solve that can typically be solved by the client within the time that it takes to type a message.

In some examples, the battery powered devices use the additional information to determine more accurate listening windows based on a drift time of their internal clocks, and a jitter time of the network and/or a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Additionally, techniques for modifying when mains powered devices update their internal clocks based on transmission of beacons to downstream devices are described herein. For instance, the mains powered devices may refrain from updating their internal clocks to an updated network reference time until transmission of downstream beacons have occurred.

These nanoparticles can be formed by nanoprecipitation of poly(vinyl benzoate) in water using Pluronic F68 as surfactant, to create spherical nanostructures measuring about 200-250 nm in diameter which are stable in phosphate buffer and blood serum, and only slowly degrade in the presence of esterases. Kinetics experiments in phosphate buffer indicate that 78% of the coumarin-6 was encapsulated within the polymer matrix of the nanoparticle, and the residual 22% of coumarin-6 was surface-bound and quickly released. The nanoparticles are non-toxic in vitro towards human epithelial cells (IC.sub.50>1000 .mu.g/mL) and primary bovine primary aortic endothelial cells (IC.sub.50>500 .mu.g/mL), and exert non-observable bactericidal activity against a selection of representative test microbes (MIC>250 .mu.g/mL). Poly(vinyl benzoate) nanoparticles are suitable carriers for molecular delivery of lipophilic small molecules such as drugs pharmaceutical and imaging agents.

(Cambridge, MA), Vuillemin; Laurent (Montigny le Bretonneux, FR)	Mentor Graphics Corporation	Various aspects of the present disclosed technology relate to techniques for selective conditional stall for speeding up hardware-based circuit verification. A path-breaking circuit device is inserted into a location of a design path configured to generate a stall signal indicating whether a change of signal between a pair of neighboring clock cycles of a clock signal is detected at the location. The stall signal is used to directly or indirectly suppress, when the change of signal between the pair of neighboring clock cycles is detected, the next state updating for state element models in the hardware model of circuit design. The design path is usually the critical design path. The insertion location is usually selected to be a location where the signal does not change frequently.

Checking circuitry is coupled to the scan chain and generates a first digital signature based on data indicative of a pre-testing status of the digital circuit as the data is unloaded from the digital circuit via the scan chain. When testing is completed, the data is restored to the digital circuit via the scan chain. The checking circuitry generates a second digital signature as the data is loaded into the digital circuit. The first digital signature is compared to the second digital signature to verify an integrity of the process. A specific data pattern may be loaded into the scan chain as the data is unloaded.

A step counter counts toward an overflow value representing the number of angular step markers on the coding wheel. The step counter and the index are correlated: when the overflow value is reached, if the index marker is not detected an error is raised; coincidently, when the index marker is detected, if the step counter has not reached the overflow value an error is raised. The systems and methods may be applied to bidirectionally rotating motors and other devices by detecting a change in rotational direction and switching from incrementing the angular step counter to decrementing it, and vice versa.

The polar code defines a plurality of virtual channels within the physical channel and allocates a subset of the virtual channels for the transmission of data. The method for transmitting data: receives a block of data to be transmitted; receives additional data to be transmitted together with the block of data; selects one or more of the virtual channels; determines a scrambling sequence based on the additional data; applies the scrambling sequence to those bits of the block of data to generate a scrambled version of the block of data; and transmits the scrambled version of the block of data according to the polar code.

A centrifugal compressor for a turbocharger includes an inlet-adjustment mechanism in an air inlet for the compressor, operable to move between a closed position, an open position, and a super-open position. The compressor also includes a ported shroud system. The inlet-adjustment mechanism includes a plurality of blades disposed about the air inlet and movable radially inwardly and outwardly for defining the various positions. In the closed position, the effective diameter of air inlet is reduced and the blades block flow through the ported shroud system. In the open position, the blades still block the ported shroud but the effective inlet diameter is increased relative to the closed position. In the super-open position, the blades unblock the ported shroud so that an additional amount of flow can pass through the ported shroud, thereby shifting the compressor's choke flow line to higher flow rates.

Load-control functionality may be distributed among a plurality of nodes within a network, allowing such nodes to send feedback to upstream nodes, and receive feedback from downstream nodes. In an example, received packets are measured, such as by summing sizes of received packets over time, to determine a received traffic-level. Transmitted packets are measured, such as by summing sizes of transmitted packets over time, to determine a transmitted traffic-level. Feedback may be sent to at least one source of the received packets based at least in part on the received traffic-level and the transmitted traffic-level. The feedback may indicate a desired rate for the sender to transmit. A node may receive data from upstream node(s) and from an internal device, such as a metrology unit. Both data sources may be controlled by feedback.

A Marangoni flow is created and characterized using amphiphiles to be characterized. The observed flow is characterized, and using the disclosed process, one can deduce from this measurement many important physicochemical parameters of the amphiphiles such as their critical micellar concentration. Compared to existing techniques, the disclosed process offers the advantage that it requires a single experiment to deduce the parameters, when other techniques (pendant drop method, conductometry, etc . . . ) require the measurement of a quantity (interfacial tension, conductometry) against a systematically varied parameter (amphiphile concentration, . . . ). The disclosed process and devices are ideal to characterize and/or screen rapidly amphiphiles molecules based on their interaction with a solvent.

In particular, a transaction may present the contextual approval information to a user in the form of an approval challenge message. The approval challenge message may be sent to a known user device via the transaction server in the form of a text or multi-media message. The user may respond to the message with an approval or denial response.

A transceiver circuit and related radio frequency (RF) circuit are provided. An RF circuit is coupled to a transceiver circuit configured to generate an envelope tracking (ET) target voltage. The RF circuit includes a tracker circuit and a power amplifier circuit(s). The tracker circuit may have inherent frequency-dependent impedance that can interact with a load current of the amplifier circuit(s) to cause degradation in an ET modulated voltage, which can lead to spectral distortions in an RF offset spectrum. As such, a voltage compensation circuit is provided in the transceiver circuit and configured to add a voltage compensation term in the ET target voltage. By adding the voltage compensation term into the ET target voltage, it is possible to compensate for the degradation in the ET modulated voltage, thus helping to reduce the spectral distortions in the RF offset spectrum and improve linearity and efficiency of the amplifier circuit(s).

After encapsulation of the first pattern, a cavity is formed between the contact regions by etching through openings, and then filled with a material constituting the absorption region by lateral epitaxy of this material from the lateral walls of the cavity. According to one possibility, a first lateral epitaxy is effected in order to form a multiplication region, and then a second lateral epitaxy is effected in order to form a charge region before the lateral epitaxy of the material constituting the absorption region, so as to obtain a lateral avalanche photodiode having improved optical confinement. The lateral photodiode according to the invention has improved optical confinement.

The unit includes a high performance vibration sensor useful for monitoring the host machine for fault conditions and the like. The unit includes a second vibration sensor that has poorer metrological performance, but draws a comparatively insignificant amount of power from the battery. The second sensor takes a vibration measure periodically, which measure is processed to evaluate whether the machine is in a state eligible to undergo a health assessment. Diagnostic monitoring using the high performance vibration sensor is enabled only when the host machine it is in the eligible state. A low power temperature sensor provides additional data for guarding against a false trigger, in effect allowing the processor to distinguish against vibration from another machine propagating to the host machine causing the host machine to vibrate while the host machine is not running.

Efficient optimization of schedules in a public transportation system	10,546,255	G06Q 10/063116 (20130101)	G06Q 10/06 (20120101)Zaourar-Michel; Sofia (Grenoble, FR)	Conduent Business Services, LLC	Methods and systems are disclosed for optimizing public transportation schedules. Shifts from current schedules associated with a public transportation system can be evaluated. The impact on waiting times can then be determined, based on evaluating the shifts from the current schedules. Schedules associated with the public transportation system are then optimized based on the impact on the waiting times. Public transport schedules can thus be optimized by minimizing the waiting time during, for example, transfers. Using ticket validation data to construct a realistic scenario-based model of the waiting times, a goal of this approach is to compute shifts of the current schedules that reduce the overall expected waiting time.

System for mapping a set of related strings on an ontology with a global submodular function	10,546,009	G06F 16/367 (20190101)	G06F 16/36 (20190101)Galle; Matthias (Saint-Martin-d'Heres, FR), Lagos; Nikolaos (Grenoble, FR)	Conduent Business Services, LLC	A computer-implemented system and method provide for mapping a set of strings onto an ontology which may be represented as a graph. The method includes receiving a set of strings, each string denoting a respective object. For each of the strings, a pairwise similarity is computed between the string and each of a set of objects in the ontology. For each of a set of candidate subsets (subgraphs) of the set of objects, a global score is computed, which is a function of the pairwise similarities between the strings and the objects in the subset and a tightness score. The tightness score is computed on the objects in the subset with a submodular function. An optimal subset is identified from the set of candidate subsets based on the global scores. Strings in the set of strings are mapped to the objects in the optimal subset, based on the pairwise similarities.	CONDUENT BUSINESS SERVICES, LLC	US	US. Appl.

The method determines a combined proportion cube from a first meshed proportion cube and a second meshed proportion cube. The invention combines some facies models giving vertical probabilities and some facies models giving horizontal probabilities. This determination is particularly efficient in the presence of a zero probability in one of these models and is capable of respecting the mathematical constraint according to which the sum of each row and each column in the final proportion model must be equal to a predetermined maximum value.
